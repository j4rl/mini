Miniblog system with login, blog entrys, comments and user registration.

This is an example of how you could build a blog system. (Or anything else)
This example uses HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, PHP and SQL.

## Setting up the database

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. Create a new database in your MySQL server.
2. Import the `example_database.sql` file into the newly created database. This file contains SQL statements to create the necessary tables (`tblblog`, `tblUser`, and `tbltext`) and populate them with example data.
3. Update the database connection settings in the `func.php` file to match your MySQL server configuration.
4. Run the application and verify that the database has been set up correctly.
